Hello and thank you for visiting my Python phylogenetic tree application. This application is meant to generate a phylogenetic tree from a multi-FASTA file containing the sequence of a gene in multiple species using three distinct algorithms: Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony, and K-mer Alignment-Free.

The program is written in Python and requires the installation of the following modules:
•	BioPython
•	Numpy
•	Matplotlib
•	NumPy
•	Pandas

To execute the application, you must supply the Multi-FASTA file containing gene sequences from many species.

Please keep in mind that the tree built by the K-mer Alignment-Free algorithm may be reversed when compared to trees generated by other popular applications such as MEGA. This is due to the various methods utilized to compute evolutionary distances and build the tree.

Please email me if you have any queries or problems executing the application.

Thank you for utilizing my software!
